### Hi, there ðŸ‘‹

I am Ricki Bin Yamin. I'm an iOS Developer and also an Electrical Engineer. I was graduated from Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), Surabaya. I had completed my journey at Apple Developer Academy @UC on 2019 batch. My current interest is exploring more and more about Software Engineering field, but not forgetting my Electrical Engineering skills.
